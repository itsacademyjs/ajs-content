# Specifying Attributes to Elements

Attributes specify extra information to your element. Attributes have pre-defined names, and are assigned a value.

In the following code snippet, you can see three key-value pair. The attribute names, `attribute`, `attribute2` and `attribute3` are the keys, and the values they are assigned to are `value`, `value2` and `value3`.

```html
<name_of_the_tag
    attribute="value"
    attribute2="value2"
    attribute3="value3">
    Hello, world!
</name_of_the_tag>
```
