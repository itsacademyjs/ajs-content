Sometimes, you might want to write things in your HTML document that might improve the readability of your source code. This could be instructions, segregation of content, or just reminders to add or remove features.

This is where comments come in. HTML comments help you document your code, and they are not displayed in the browser.

The syntax to add a comment in HTML is as follows -

```html
<!---
This is a comment
-->
<h1>AcademyJS</h1
```
