# Splitting Tables into Head, Body and Foot

Tables in HTML can have three parts:
* The Table Head
* The Table Body
* The Table Foot

The table head and table body are very similar - since they are essentially a single cell of data that might provide any additional information about the table.

The body of the table contains all the actual data the table is supposed to show.

You can create these parts of the table using the following HTML tags:
* `<thead>`
* `<tbody>`
* `<tfoot>`

Here is an example of a table that has all three parts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Table</title>
</head>
<body>
<table border="1" width="100%">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="4">
            This is the head of the table   
        </td>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tfoot>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="4">
            This is the foot of the table
        </td>
    </tr>
</tfoot>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Cell 1</td>
        <td>Cell 2</td>
        <td>Cell 3</td>
        <td>Cell 4</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note! Your table may have a single or several `<tbody>` elements, but it is important that the `<thead>` and `<tfoot>` elements come before the group of `<tbody>` tags.

## Output

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Table</title>
</head>
<body>
<table border="1" width="100%">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="4">
            This is the head of the table   
        </td>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tfoot>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="4">
            This is the foot of the table
        </td>
    </tr>
</tfoot>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Cell 1</td>
        <td>Cell 2</td>
        <td>Cell 3</td>
        <td>Cell 4</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</body>
