# Understanding Block Level and Inline Elements


In HTML, elements are categorized as either block-level elements or inline-level elements.

A block-level element occupies 100% width of the parent element. Its height is equal to its content. Further, the browser adds a newline before and after the block. These are the default styles for a block-level element, but you can modify them using CSS.

To visualize a block-level element, open the following document in your browser:

```html
<html>
 <head>
   <title>Visualizing Block-Level Element</title>
 </head>
 <body>
   <p style="background-color: black; color: white">
     Can you see me? I am a block!
   </p>
 </body>
</html>
 ```

Block-level elements can appear only inside the `body` element. You cannot use it inside the `head` element. Some examples of block-level elements include: div, code, blockquote, address, article, form, and so on.

An inline-level element on the other hand occupies both the width and the height equal to its content. It does not start a newline. Again, these are the default styles for an inline-level element, but you can modify them using CSS.

```html
<html>
 <head>
   <title>Visualizing Inline-Level Element</title>
 </head>
 <body>
   <p>
     This is a paragraph.
     <span style="background-color: black; color: white">This is a span.</span>
     Okay, bye!
   </p>
 </body>
</html>
``` 

In general, you should put only inline-level elements or data in inline-level elements. You should not put block-level elements.
