# Using Images as Links

You can wrap an `<img>` tag with the anchor tag to use the image as a link.

This can be used to make cool looking buttons and other clickable elements, but there are better ways of doing such things using CSS.

Here is an example of using images as links -

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>HTML Image as link</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      The following image works as a link:<br>
      <a href="https://www.qries.com/">
         <img alt="Qries" src="https://www.qries.com/images/banner_logo.png"
         width=150" height="70">
      </a>
   </body>
</html>
```
## Output

---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>HTML Image as link</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      The following image works as a link:
      <br />
      <br />
      <a href="https://www.google.com/">
         <img alt="Google" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg/250px-Google_2015_logo.svg.png"
         width=150" height="50">
      </a>
   </body>
</html>
