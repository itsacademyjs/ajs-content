# Embedding Videos

The `<video>` HTML element embeds a default media player which supports video playback into the document. 

The video player is provided by your browser, so your document might look slight different on different browsers.

You can use `<video>` for audio content as well, but the `<audio>` element may provide a more appropriate user experience.

The video tag takes few attributes which are not mandatory, such as width, height and controls (which shows the video controls if provided with the value true, and does not otherwise).

You can also put text between the video tag that will be rendered if the browser does not support the video tag (highly unlikely).


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<video width="320" height="240" controls=true>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

</body>
</html>
```
## Output
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<video width="320" height="240" controls=true>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</body>
</html>
