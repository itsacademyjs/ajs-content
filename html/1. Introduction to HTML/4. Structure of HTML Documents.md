# Structure of HTML Documents

In the last section you learnt that an HTML document is essentially a collection a HTML elements.

The basic structure of these documents can be summed up using three elements or tags. These tags don't change the look of the webpage in any manner. These three tags are as follows:

1. The `<html>` tag: This tag wraps the entire HTML document. This element represents the root of an HTML document. The root of any HTML document is it's top level element. Think of this the hard cover of a large book that keeps the contents of the book in one place.
2. The `<head>` tag: This tag is like a preface of a big book. It briefly specifies the contents in the rest of file. This is also where you will link your CSS files, your JS scripts, your site meta-data and xml files, the title of the document and the favicon the browser should display when the document is opened.
3. The `<body>` tag: This tag has the main content of the document. Everything that you see inside of a browser is written between the `<body>` tags. This could include all the text your webpage is supposed to show, images, audio files, video files, tables, input forms and much, much more!
