# Ordered Lists

The `<ol>` HTML element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.

Typically, ordered list items display with a preceding marker, such as a number or letter.

The `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements may nest as deeply as desired, alternating between `<ol>` and `<ul>` however you like.

The `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements both represent a list of items. The difference is with the `<ol>` element, the order is meaningful. For example:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Fee</li>
  <li>Fi</li>
  <li>Fo</li>
  <li>Fum</li>
</ol>
```
The above snippet will render a list that looks like this - 

<ol>
  <li>Fee</li>
  <li>Fi</li>
  <li>Fo</li>
  <li>Fum</li>
</ol>

You can also switch to roman numerals as shown

```html
<ol type="i">
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>List of Greivances</li>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
```
Output: 

<ol type="i">
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>List of Greivances</li>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

---


Ordered lists also allows you to start from any point in the list as shown below:

```html
<ol start="4">
  <li>Speedwalk Stu</li>
  <li>Saunterin’ Sam</li>
  <li>Slowpoke Rodriguez</li>
</ol>
```

Output:
<ol start="4">
  <li>Speedwalk Stu</li>
  <li>Saunterin’ Sam</li>
  <li>Slowpoke Rodriguez</li>
</ol>
