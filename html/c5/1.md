# Unordered Lists

The `<ul>` HTML element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.

You can use unordered lists when you have a collection of items that cannot or do not have a numerical ordering. Or maybe, numbering or ordering in the list you want to display is meaningless.

The `<ul>` and `<ol>` elements may be nested as deeply as desired. You can learn more about nested lists here.

Moreover, the nested lists may alternate between `<ol>` and `<ul>`. You might have noticed that both the `<ol>` and the `<ul>` tags are very similar.

The `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements both represent a list of items. 

The only difference is that, with the `<ol>` element, the order is meaningful. 

As a rule of thumb to determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items. If the meaning is changed by the changed order, the `<ol>` element should be used, otherwise you can use `<ul>`.

```html
<ul>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>second item</li>
  <li>third item</li>
</ul>
```

## Output
---
<ul>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>second item</li>
  <li>third item</li>
</ul>
