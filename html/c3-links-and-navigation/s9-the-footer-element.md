Yet another semantic tag introduced by HTML5 is the footer tag. The footer element can be just another navigation element, with more details about the website suchs as terms of conditions, contact details and other legal documents.

The `<footer>` HTML element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.

Although having footers for each section is completely valid, it is not recommended and is not considered good practice.

A `<footer>` may also contain information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
