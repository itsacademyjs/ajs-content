HTML5 has introduced a lot of semantic tags that allow more expressiveness and give meaning to the structure of your page than simply using `div`s with meaningful `id`s.

The `<nav>` HTML element is one of them, and it represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links.

The navigation links can either come from within the current document or to other documents. 

Common examples of navigation sections are menus and tables of contents.
