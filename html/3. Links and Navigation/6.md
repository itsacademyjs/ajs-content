# Linking to email address and telephone numbers

To create links that open in the user's email program to let them send a new message, use the mailto: scheme:

```
<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere
</a>
```
For details about mailto: URLs, such as including a subject or body, see Email links or RFC 6068.

Linking to telephone numbers

```
<a href="tel:+49.157.0156">+49 157 0156</a>
<a href="tel:+1(555)5309">(555) 5309</a>
```

`tel`: link behavior varies with device capabilities:

* Cellular devices autodial the number.
* Most operating systems have programs that can make calls, like Skype or FaceTime.
Websites can make phone calls with registerProtocolHandler, such as web.skype.com.
* Other behaviors include saving the number to contacts, or sending the number to another device.
