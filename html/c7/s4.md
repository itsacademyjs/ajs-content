# Creating Paragraphs

As we just saw in the previous sections, the `<p>` HTML element represents a paragraph. 

You might have paragraphs as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines or sometimes with a little indentation on the first line.

 HTML paragraphs are just limited to these kind of paragraphs. They can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

Paragraphs are block-level elements. This means that if you like living on the edge and open another block-level element inside the `<p>` tags, meaning another block-level element is encountered before `</p>` is encountered, it will automatically close.
