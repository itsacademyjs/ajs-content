# Understanding Forms

So far you have learnt how to display text, images, video, audio, tables and lists in your HTML document. But you might also have situations where your HTML document requires some amount of interactivity - meaning you might want to take information from to user as opposed to giving information to the user.

That's where forms come in.

The `<form>` element represents a section in your HTML document that contains interactive controls required for submitting user information.

Here is an example of a simple form that takes the user's name and email address:

```html
<form action="" method="get" class="form-example">
  <div class="form-example">
    <label for="name">Enter your name: </label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required>
  </div>
  <div class="form-example">
    <label for="email">Enter your email: </label>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>
  </div>
  <div class="form-example">
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe!">
  </div>
</form>
```

The above code snippet gives the following output:

## Output
---
<form action="" method="get" class="form-example">
  <div class="form-example">
    <label for="name">Enter your name: </label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required>
  </div>
  <div class="form-example">
    <label for="email">Enter your email: </label>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>
  </div>
  <div class="form-example">
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe!">
  </div>
</form>

As you can see from the above example, forms can contain one or more `<input>` elements.

The `<input>` HTML element is used to create interactive controls inside your forms.

A wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available.

The `<input>` element is very powerful due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes. We will learn more about these different types of input in the coming sections.
