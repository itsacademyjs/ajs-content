# Creating Line Breaks

You might want to have text in your document starting in new lines. That's where the break element comes in.

The `<br>` element creates a line break in a block of text. 

Since that happens to be the sole purpose the `<br>` tag, it also happens to be a self-closing tag is often used as shown in the following example.

```html
<p>This is a text that is about to <br /> break.<p>
```

---
<p>This is a text that is about to <br /> break.<p>

---


Also the break element has no dimensions or visual styles. But there are some amount of styles you can add to your break elements.

For example, you might want to increase the spacing between lines of text, for which you can set a margin on `<br>` elements themselves.

But we recommend you don't do this. The break element must be left unstyled for all intents and purposes. Styling break elements is a bad practice â€” instead you should be using the line-height property that was designed for that purpose.
