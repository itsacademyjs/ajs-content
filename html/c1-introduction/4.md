# Structure of HTML Documents

The basic structure of these documents can be summed up using three tags. These tags don't change the look of the webpage in any manner. These three tags are as follows:

1. The ```<html>``` tag: This tag wraps the entire HTML document.
2. The ```<head>``` tag: This tag is like a preface of a big book. It briefly specifies the contents in the rest of file.
3. The ```<body>``` tag: This tag has the main content of the document.
