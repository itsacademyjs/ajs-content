# Understanding Elements

An HTML page is basically a collection of HTML elements. There are many types of HTML elements such as `p`, `img`, `div`, and `span`. You can use these elements to structure information such as lists, paragraphs, quotes, links, embed images, create forms, and so on. 

An HTML element is made up of opening tag, attributes, children, and closing tag.

An opening tag is wrapped within angle brackets and specifies the name of the element. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. Tags like `p`, `span`, and `div` provide information about content. Tags like `img` and `audio` introduce new content into the document. We will learn more about tags as we progress through the course. Example: <p>

A closing tag is wrapped within angle brackets, specifies the name of the element, and includes a forward slash. Example: </p>

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My First HTML Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello, AcademyJS!</p>
    </body>
</html>
