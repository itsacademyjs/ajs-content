# Embedding Images: The Image Embed Element

The `<img>` HTML element embeds an image into the document.

The element has some required and some non-required attributes as discussed below.

The ```src``` attribute is required, and contains the path to the image you want to embed. The path can be a URL or a local file.

The alt attribute holds a text description of the image. This attribute is not required, although, it is highly recommended that you use them.

This is because screen readers read this description out to their users so they know what the image means. 

Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason. The text is displayed in the area the image would be displayed in case of network errors or broken links.

There are many other advanced attributes to achieve various purposes:

* Referrer/CORS control for security and privacy: see crossorigin and referrerpolicy.
* It is best practice to use width and height to set the size of the image. This allows it to take up space before it even loads. This solves a lot of problems, especially layout shift problems. Not using this may result in content layout shifts.
