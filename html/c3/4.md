# Linking to a specific part of the page

The anchor tag also let's you scroll to a specific part of the page using the section's ID. Here is an example of a anchor element which links to the `h2` element under it.

```html
<!-- <a> element links to the section below -->
<p>
<a href="#Section_further_down">
  Jump to the heading below
</a>
</p>

<!-- Heading to link to -->
<h2 id="Section_further_down">Section further down</h2>
```
