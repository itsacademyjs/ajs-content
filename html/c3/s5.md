# Targeting New Windows with Hyperlinks

When you use external hyperlinks on your website, clicking on these anchor tags would result in your user being redirected to another external page.

This isn't necessarily good for you, because the user might not even come back to your website.

Therefore, you can use the target attribute with the value `_blank`. This will open the link in a new tab. So your user does not leave your website but can still open and see all the external links you have used in your HTML page.

```html
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org">
  Wikipedia (opens in new tab)
</a>
```
