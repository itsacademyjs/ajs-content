# Understanding URLs

In this chapter, we'll be learning about links and navigation. 

We'll start with the URL. URL is one of the key concepts of the Web. It is the mechanism used by browsers to retrieve any published resource on the web.

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is the address of a given unique resource on the Web. 

In theory, every valid URL points to some unique resource like an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc. 

In reality, however, there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resourcethat has moved. 

As the resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.
