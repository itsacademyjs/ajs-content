# Understanding Directories and Directory Structure

Here are some rules to keep in mind when writing directory and file paths as links in your HTML.

* Suppose you want to link to a target file that is in the same folder or directory as your HTML file, just use the filename. Don't forget to include the extension as part of the name. Here is an example - ```my-image.jpg```.
* If you want to reference a file in a subdirectory, and the subdirectory is inside the same level or same folder as the HTML file calling it (we will call this the invoking HTML from here on), just write the directory name in front of the path, plus a forward slash. Here is an example -  ```subdirectory/my-image.jpg```.
* The final case is when your file is in the directory above the invoking HTML file. In these cases, you can navigate one level above your invoking directory by appending two dots. For example, if index.html was inside a subfolder of test-site and my-image.jpg was inside test-site, you could reference my-image.jpg from index.html using ```../my-image.jpg```.

Now that you know the rules of navigating through the directory structure, you can combine these as much as possible. Here is an example - ```../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg```.
