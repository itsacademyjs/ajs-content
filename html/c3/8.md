# The Section Element

The `<section>` HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document.

This section is used when there may not be a more specific semantic element to represent it. 

Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions. 

It is good practice and recommended that each of your sections contain either an `<h1>` tag, or each section contains an `<h2>` tag with the root element containing an `<h1>` heading representing the entire group of sections.
