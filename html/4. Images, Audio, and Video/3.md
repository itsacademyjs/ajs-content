# Image Accessibility with the Alternative Attribute

The `alt` attribute defines an alternative text description of the image.

Omitting alt altogether indicates that the image is a key part of the content and no textual equivalent is available. Setting this attribute to an empty string (alt="") indicates that this image is not a key part of the content (itâ€™s decoration or a tracking pixel), and that non-visual browsers may omit it from rendering. Visual browsers will also hide the broken image icon if the alt is empty and the image failed to display.

This attribute is also used when copying and pasting the image to text, or saving a linked image to a bookmark.
