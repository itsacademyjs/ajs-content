The great thing about bread is you can eat it with anything! It is so generic. It's almost like it has no personality.

The `<span>` HTML element is exactly like bread - boring and with no personality.

The span element is a generic inline container. It is used to group together content. Semantically, it doesn't mean anything (Atleast inherently. It does mean something when you use it in certain ways, but we'll get to that in a bit.) 

You might want to use the Span element for various reasons, such as grouping elements together for style, or for segregation, or maybe your elements have the same attribute value (for example, they might all have to same value for an attribute, say "language").

The `span` element is just like the `div` that you learnt about in Chapter 1. [Click Here]() for a quick recap.

The only difference is that `span` is an inline element, where as a `div` is a block level element. You can read more about Inline and Block-level elements [here]().
