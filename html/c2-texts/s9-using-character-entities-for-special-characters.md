Let's first understand what an entity is.

An HTML entity is just a string or text that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;) . 

You can use these pre-defined entities to display reserved characters.

The reason of using entities instead of using the characters directly is simply because these characters are reserved and would be interpreted as HTML code otherwise.

You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
