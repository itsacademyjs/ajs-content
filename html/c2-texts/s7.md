# Preformatted Text

The `<pre>` HTML element represents preformatted text. This is especially helpful when you want something to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or ```monospaced```, font. 

Text enclosed in the preformatted tags include all characters, hence, even whitespace and tab characters are shown.
