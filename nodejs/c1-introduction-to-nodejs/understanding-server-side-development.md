Up till now, you might have developed and designed websites using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. These enable user interaction on the client-side, in the browser for example. 

To become a full-stack developer, you now have to learn about the backend.

What is a full-stack developer? Fullstack in its simplest form is front-end development plus backend (also known as server-side) development. 

Let's understand the backend with an analogy of a Michelin star restaurant.

<Illustration>

In the above illustration, the restaurant is divided into three parts:
 * Front of House/Main Restaurant (Client-side)
 * Kitchen (Server-side)
 * Larder (Database)

The main restaurant is what the user sees in the browser. The user sees the information being displayed using HTML and CSS and is also able to interact with the website using JavaScript. 

A little further on the back, in the backend, we’ve got the kitchen where all of the dishes get served. The kitchen here is analogous to our server. When a customer asks for a particular dish, that order gets sent to the kitchen (server). The kitchen should then send back what the customer wants, which is the actual dish. 

Finally, the larder where all the ingredients are stored is of course analogous to the database. All of our user data and the data that make our website work are stored in the database.

What would happen if you don’t have a kitchen to create everything and could have a restaurant that brings all of the ingredients and makes its dishes in front of the customer? The downside would be your secret recipe passed down over generations is now exposed. Anybody would be able to replicate it!

If you had something you intend to keep secret, such as your API keys or how you implement your particular application, then you most likely would not want that to be visible every time somebody loads up your website. It’s the same for the business logic of your website. 

Another problem is that this whole process can be time-consuming. Imagine having to bring all of the ingredients to the front and create dishes in small batches. In websites, that translates to a long loading time. Transporting a whole load of code over to the browser and executing that on the browser usually takes longer than if it was done on the backend.

The preferable alternative is for our server to interact with the database, apply our business logic to the data, and return a response that can be displayed to the user. This way, you can vastly speed up your website and keep your business logic confidential.

In the coming lessons, we’re going to be delving deep into backend development with Node.js!
