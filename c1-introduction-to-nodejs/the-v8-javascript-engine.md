V8 is an open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. The project was developed by the Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers and is the most used JavaScript engine. It runs on Mac, Windows, Linux, and several other systems. It has been used on the server-side, for example in Couchbase and Node.js, among others. 

V8 can run standalone which means it is independent of the browser in which it is hosted. It was this key feature that powered Node.js, enabling it to rise to popularity.

In browsers, V8 provides a runtime environment in which JavaScript executes while the browser provides the DOM and other web platform APIs.  

Other browsers have their own JavaScript engines:
 * SpiderMonkey was developed by Mozilla for use in Firefox.
 * JavaScriptCore, also called Nitro, is Appleâ€™s engine for its Safari browser.
 * Chakra of the Internet Explorer browser was forked by Microsoft for the original Edge browser. However, Edge was later rebuilt as a Chromium-based browser and now uses V8.

All the engines mentioned above implement the ECMA ES-262 standard, also called ECMAScript, the standard used by JavaScript.

V8 is forever evolving, just like the other JavaScript engines around to improve the latency time. As long as the quest for performance exists, we as users and developers benefit a lot as we get faster and more optimized machines year after year.
