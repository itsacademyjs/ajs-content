We’ve seen why and how awesome Node is, but what exactly does it do?

Until now, you might have worked with JavaScript to merely design websites on the front-end. Your JavaScript code has been kept captive inside the browser. 

The code has only been able to interact with the browser, request information from the browser, and add event listeners to components in the browser. However, your JavaScript code can’t go beyond the boundaries of the browser. The code isn’t able to reach out of the browser into the user’s system and get access to the file system, or the networking processes, etc.

There’s a superlative reason for that. You don’t want to load up a website with malicious code and bugs trying to tap into your local file system. It would be dangerous if someone could look into your local files. 

However, there are some situations where if you decide to build a desktop application, like Atom for example, then you need to access the file system. In these situations, you need to be able to access the file system or work with the network. 

In other words, you need to be able to write code that can interact directly with the system, independent of the browser. This is exactly what Node.js allows us to do. Node.js takes JavaScript out of the browser and liberates it, allowing it to directly interact with the operating system.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside browsers. It is based on the V8 engine.
