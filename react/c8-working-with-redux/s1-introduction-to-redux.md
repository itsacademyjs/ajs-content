Redux is a state container for JavaScript apps. You can use Redux with React, Angular, Vue or just regular vanilla Javascript. 

In this tutorial, we will learn to use Redux with React. Redux is a very tiny dependency (just 2kB). The official approach of adding Redux to your project is by using the Redux toolkit. You can add it to your project using NPM or yarn using the following commands - 

# NPM
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

# Yarn
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit

The toolkit includes utilities with common use cases, like store setup and creating reducers and writing immutable update logic, but we’ll keep all that for later. For now, before we get our hands dirty and write some code, let’s just understand what the concept of Redux is.
