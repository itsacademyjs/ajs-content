React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with UI.
Some cases include how events are handled, how the state changes over time,
and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic
in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called
components that contain both.

Components are independent, isolated, and reusable bits of code. In this chapter,
we will learn to build our own reusable components.
