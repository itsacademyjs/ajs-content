All the components you have made so far are React components, or in other words, they are classes that extend the React.Component class. This React.Component class contains a `state` object. 

The `state` object is where you store values that are necessary for your front-end logic, say values like a counter for a shopping cart component or the username in a text field component. Every single time one of these values change, we say that a state has changed. This will change the state object in your component. React automatically re-renders your component when itâ€™s state object has a change.
