# CSS Projects

## Project 1 - Improve Tribute Page

Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React.

## Project 2 - Create a Portfolio Page

Your portfolio page should have the following components and features:

* Your portfolio page should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section.
* The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text.
* Your portfolio page should have a projects section with an id of projects.
* The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project.
* The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.
* Your portfolio page should have a navbar with an id of navbar.
* The navbar should contain at least one link that you can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.
* Your portfolio page should have a link with an id of profile-link, which opens your GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab.
* Your portfolio page should have at least one media query.
* The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.
